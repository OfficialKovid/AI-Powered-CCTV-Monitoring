Assignment: AI-Powered CCTV
Monitoring & Reporting System
Objective
Your task is to build an AI-powered CCTV monitoring system that can analyze video
feeds, detect specific activities or anomalies, and generate structured reports. This will
test your ability to:
• Process real-time video streams with Python & AI
• Implement an AI agent architecture using LangGraph
• Detect objects and actions in video using computer vision (e.g., OpenCV,
YOLO, or a Vision Transformer)
• Generate structured reports based on detected activities
User Story: AI CCTV Monitoring for a Retail Store
Background
A large retail chain, SmartMart, has multiple CCTV cameras monitoring their stores.
They want an AI-powered system to:
1. Detect unauthorized access (e.g., customers entering staff-only areas).
2. Monitor queue lengths at checkout counters to optimize staffing.
3. Identify suspicious behavior (e.g., loitering near high-value products).
4. Generate daily reports summarizing events and store activity.
Instead of relying on security personnel watching hours of footage, SmartMart wants an
automated AI system that:
• Analyzes the live CCTV feed
• Classifies events in real-time
• Generates structured reports for store managers
